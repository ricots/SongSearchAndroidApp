# SongSearchAndroidApp
Song Search Android App is an app that allows you to currently search for a song title or by an artist prefix. App currently pulls from a list of 10,514 songs hosted on USM's site.


App uses a custom data structure known as a Ragged Array List that was built in the data structures class that I am currently taken. There are currently two different ways to search for a song, by Title which utilizes the Ragged Array List, and by Artist which uses a standard array.
